    "# Predictive models for clinical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be exploring the factors that may influence the performance of predictive models for the clinical significance of prostate lesions on mpMRI images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data consists of mpMRI images and annotations prepared by three radiologists, as well as clinical information and biopsy results with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Gleason grading for each lesion. The radiologists annotated the data with multiple imaging features for each lesion, using the assessment algorithm from the PI-RADS standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses, we will be using a supervised learning algorithm to train separate models for each factor of interest, using the mpMRI images and the biopsy results as inputs. We will extract the radiomics features using a dedicated library that calculates features based on the intensity, texture, and shape of the lesions. We will then use cross-validation to assess the performance of each model, and compare the models using measures such as AUC-ROC or F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the data."
