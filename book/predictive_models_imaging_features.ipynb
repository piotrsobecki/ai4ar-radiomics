    "Our data consists of mpMRI images and annotations prepared by three radiologists, as well as clinical information and biopsy results with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Gleason grading for each lesion. The radiologists annotated the data with multiple imaging features for each lesion, using the assessment algorithm from the PI-RADS standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheses, we will be using a supervised learning algorithm to train models on the mpMRI images and the annotated imaging features. We will extract the radiomics features using a dedicated library that calculates features based on the intensity, texture, and shape of the lesions. We will then use cross-validation to assess the performance of the models, and visualize the results using scatter plots.\n",
