# AI4AR - Radiomics Study

Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Early detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer are essential for improving patient outcomes. Prostate magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that has been shown to be effective in detecting and characterizing prostate lesions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the use of radiomics, which involves the extraction of quantitative imaging features from mpMRI images, to predict the imaging features and clinical significance of prostate lesions.

## Data


During the AI4AR study, we collected mpMRI images of the prostate gland along with annotations prepared by three experienced radiologists with a minimum of 3 years of experience in interpreting mpMRI images for oncological purposes (prostate). The radiologists had no access to patient history or the location of biopsy-proven lesions, and the annotations were made independently. In total, four radiologists participated in the data collection process.

The annotations included segmentation masks of the prostate gland and detected lesions, as well as additional imaging features for each lesion based on the PI-RADS assessment algorithm. These features included measures such as lesion homogeneity, shape, and margins.

## Motivation

This study investigates the use of radiomics, which involves the extraction of quantitative imaging features from mpMRI images, as a tool for predicting the imaging features and clinical significance of prostate lesions. Early detection and accurate characterization of prostate cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes, and mpMRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that has been shown to be effective in detecting and characterizing prostate lesions. However, the manual assessment of imaging features by radiologists can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. The use of radiomics to automate the process of feature extraction and prediction has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis. By demonstrating the feasibility and potential of radiomics in this context, this study may have significant implications for the clinical management of prostate cancer.
